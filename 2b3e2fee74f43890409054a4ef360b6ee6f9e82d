These docs essentially say \"this parameter is not ignored no matter what you do\", which is a good thing, but not something to show to the user in my opinion (and definitely not in the docs of a specific IO format).\n\nIt\u0027s a good description on \"how stuff is implemented\", and at the same time the implementation is not really just in one helper function -\u003e the commit message looks like a perfect place to me.",
