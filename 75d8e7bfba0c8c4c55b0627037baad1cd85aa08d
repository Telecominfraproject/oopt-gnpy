      "message": "When I saw this, I wondered how come it\u0027s  \u0027+\u0027 and not \u0027-\u0027. If the slot width is, say, 100 GHz, the channel power will typically be twice as high (assuming a constant PSD, which I think is reasonable because of amplifier saturation point and the fact that we have one half of channels with 100 GHz). But this is not about per-channel power, but about a \"power per standard 50 GHz channel\", and that\u0027s why substraction is a correct operation here (AFAICT).\n\nI think this deserves at least a comment in the code, and I also suggest renaming these variables from `pin_ch` to something like `pin_50ghz`.",
