      "message": "I mean internal consistency. The loss coefficient, for example, is defined with a reference frequency of 193.5THz. Moreover, in core.elements.Fiber the attribute alpha0 and chromatic dispersion were calculated with respect a reference frequency with default vale of 193.5 THz. I think I will push a change where this reference frequency is used in all this cases, leaving out hard coded values.",

      "message": "Ok, I agree it\u0027s good to be internally consistent. But that doesn\u0027t motivate using frequency instead of wavelength as original reference. We could still calculate reference frequency based on 1550 nm wavelength and use that in all those cases.",
