      "message": "I mean internal consistency. The loss coefficient, for example, is defined with a reference frequency of 193.5THz. Moreover, in core.elements.Fiber the attribute alpha0 and chromatic dispersion were calculated with respect a reference frequency with default vale of 193.5 THz. I think I will push a change where this reference frequency is used in all this cases, leaving out hard coded values.",
