      "message": "The slot_width is used to check that adjacent channels don\u0027t overlap and within the ggn_spectrally_separated method. The general idea is that the slot_width of a given channel is slightly larger than the baud_rate (in GHz) in order to avoid the overlap of neighboring channel tails, given by the roll off. The default is evaluated only if no values is known when the spectral info is generated. There is no necessity to define a slot width that is a multiple of 12.5 GHz (even if for my understanding this is the case for real implementation of transceiver, maybe the base slot width should be changed to 6.25GHz), therefore, the answer is yes, you can pass any value, larger than the baud rate, to the slot width when you define the spectral information.",
