      "message": "I agree, but that\u0027s something for a future multiband work. In this patch, a \"composite\" amplifier refers to a \"sequence of amplifiers\", typically a dual-stage amp (but perhaps also an EDFA + Raman combination).\n\nLet\u0027s poll the developers for a favorite name for this thing:\n\n- \"dual-stage\". Cons: confusing, because some dual-stage amplifiers are modeled \"directly\" as, say, OpenROADM-booster.\n\n- \"composite\". Cons: might conflict with the future multi-band work.\n\n- \"serial\". Cons: yet another name.",
