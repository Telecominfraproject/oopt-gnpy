      "message": "this is the only way to represent a direct connection between a roadm and its booster. Am I right ?\nso it means that when translating to the usual gnpyjson topo this patch will disappear, and its loss as well... so why specifying a loss here ?\n\nagain an argument to modve to OMS :) where this ambiguity will not exist",

      "message": "The existing code (\"what is in master right now\") is rather happy to insert amplifiers via several heuristics, and not only that, but also changing the amplifier types on a ROADM-less topology. I would like to change that via this migration to YANG, so I propose the following rules:\n\n- nothing gets inserted anywhere unless explicitly allowed,\n- nothing gets replaced unless explicitly allowed,\n- a \"tentative-link\" will be replaced by a sequence of actual \"fiber\" and \"amplifier\" elements,\n- an \"amplifier-placeholder\" will be replaced by a specific \"amplifier\" element.\n\nIn the current code (as of master), a \"Roadm\" that connects directly to another \"Roadm\" usually gets replaced by a Roadm -\u003e Edfa -\u003e Fiber -\u003e Edfa -\u003e Roadm (IIRC). In this YANG topo, it will be either:\n\na) a YANG topology with \"roadm\" -- \"tentative-link\" -- \"roadm\", which gets transformed into this sequence of GNPy elements:\n\n      \"Roadm\" -- \"Edfa\" -- \"Fiber\" -- \"Edfa\" -- \"Roadm\"\n\n                           ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^--- this part can repeat many times\n\nb) a YANG topology \"roadm\" -- \"patch\" -- \"roadm\", which gets turned into this sequence of GNPy elements:\n\n      \"Roadm\" -- \"Fused\" -- \"Roadm\"\n\nOut of curiosity, how would you implement that OMS approach in YANG?",
