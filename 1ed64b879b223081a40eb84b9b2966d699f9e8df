      "message": "This proposal has been reworked compared to the first version to be more aligned with the org-openroadm-operational-mode-catalog.yang module (which I had not seen before submitting the first version). When thinking more about how OpenROADM defines penalties in their yang module, I realized that the approach with a list of up_to_boundary/penalty_value pairs is more flexible and allows a user to specify penalties in more detail by defining more points on the penalty curve, while still being compatible with specifications from vendors and other organizations.",
