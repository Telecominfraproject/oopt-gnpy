      "message": "This proposal has been reworked compared to the first version to be more aligned with the org-openroadm-operational-mode-catalog.yang module (which I had not seen before submitting the first version). When thinking more about how OpenROADM defines penalties in their yang module, I realized that the approach with a list of up_to_boundary/penalty_value pairs is more flexible and allows a user to specify penalties in more detail by defining more points on the penalty curve, while still being compatible with specifications from vendors and other organizations.",

      "message": "\u003e you fix that there will never be combined penalties\n\n\"Never\" is a strong word. I mean even standards can change so I don\u0027t think it\u0027s impossible to update gnpy later. But I could accept your proposal. I would remove the redundant \"_up_to_boundary\" for every entry and just have:\n\n \"penalties\": [\n   {\"chromatic_dispersion\": 4e3,\n    \"penalty_value\": 0},\n   {\"chromatic_dispersion\": 18e3,\n    \"penalty_value\": 0.5},\n   etc.\n ]\n\nAnd I don\u0027t think we should accept combined cd and pmd (or pdl, etc.) entries now before we know how to handle them.
