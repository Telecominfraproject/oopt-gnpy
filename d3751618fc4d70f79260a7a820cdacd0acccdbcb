Can you remove these print statements, please?\n\nAlso, I wonder if it\u0027s really needed to log these exceptions as they are raised. What do you plan to use that for? If it\u0027s about API access or a nice error messages, then it seems to me that installing a \"generic\" exception handler around the entry point is more elegant.",
