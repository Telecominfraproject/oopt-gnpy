I think that the other part of the commit message touches this, but there\u0027s a lot of what\u0027s going on which is not explained. Can you please explain that in much, much more detail?\n\n2) The information in added into the `Pref` class, not into the `SpectralInformation`",

      "message": "req_power is no more part of ref_carrier, because it was a duplicate in spectral_info:\n- present in ref-carrier and also in p_span_0\nso I preferred to keep ony one\n\nthe documentation is still correct: baudrate is needed to compute power during propagation in ROADM. once you have target_psd_out_mWperGHz. then you can multiply by the baud rate and obtain the target power for equalization. at this point the reference req_power (p_span0) is not needed.\n\nso maybe the commit message should simply explain that the role of ReferenceCarrier is just to convey the information that will be needed later on to compute power targets based on constant PSD equalization in ROADM.\n\nis this clearer ?",

      "message": "\u003e the documentation is still correct\n\nAh, OK. I was aiming for the docs of this class to describe what this class is doing; that\u0027s why I asked for adding that example about power for this class. You\u0027re right that the docstring still makes sense for the \"general picture\", which is very useful indeed.\n\nCan you please extend this class\u0027 docstring in this commit (and also in all future ones which change/move/refactor things around) so that the documentation always describes the \"current way\"? I.e., it\u0027s useful that it mentions that the PSD is the same between 32/64GBaud channels, but please also mention where the power levels are being tracked.\n\n\u003e req_power is no more part of ref_carrier, because it was a duplicate in spectral_info\n\nPlease explain that in the commit message (and also see my other comment where I point out what I do not understand in the proposed commit message).",
