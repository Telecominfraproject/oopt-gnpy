That appears to be in-line with what is defined in IETF-CCAMP WG: https://github.com/ietf-ccamp-wg/ietf-ccamp-layer0-types-ext/blob/f8ec710/ietf-layer0-types-ext.yang#L573-L608\n\nShould we follow the more complex way how this is defined in a CCAMP draft? If you ask me, yes.",

      "message": "This patch uses the same model for calculating penalty as was previously proposed by Alessio together with Lumentum. I don\u0027t remember any discussion from that time about using a \"two-dimensional space of (CD, PMD) -\u003e penalty\" (although strictly speaking the proposed model can also be seen as a 2D-function, i.e. penalty \u003d f(CD, PMD)). The problem I have with the IETF definition is that nobody specifies penalty like that today. I would prefer to use a model where we can input values now based on vendor data sheets and organizations like openroadm.",
