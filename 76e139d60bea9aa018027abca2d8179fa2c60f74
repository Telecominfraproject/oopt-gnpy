      "message": "Just a note: With the new definition of spectral information, the behaviour of elements __call__ function has changed. Before, it was an immutable namedtuple and the __call__ function returned a new spectral info without changing the input. Now it does change the input, which tricked me when plotting the spectrum after every element in gnpy.app. I don\u0027t think it\u0027s a problem since probably no one else is using low level gnpy functions like that but I thought I\u0027d leave a note here anyway.",
