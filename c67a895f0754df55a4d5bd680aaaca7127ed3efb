      "message": "I think that frequency band of amp is required even in the topology, because in the case of multiband amps, the operational values (gain, voa, tilt target mays have defferent values depending on the amplified band). \nBesides, the topo should also let the possibility to input fiber lineic loss as a set of values per frequency, to allow for different slopes in the band.",

      "message": "Allow me to rephrase -- I realize that some of these parameter will have to change once we add support for wideband/multiband simulations. However, I\u0027m OK with that because that\u0027s future work anyway, and because we need a sample data format to show to the GUI team now.\n\nWould you be OK with this, or do you prefer to address the multiband use case in the first version of a YANG topology that will be merged?",

      "message": "If you think that the future change will not impact too much the GUI team later on, we can proceed with this two step. I have some doubts, because once objects are defined in the GUI, with only one caller box for the Gain,... that might be difficult later on to change. Would it be possible to warn them and explain what\u0027s coming next , so that they can choose solutions that are compatible with this future evolution ?",
