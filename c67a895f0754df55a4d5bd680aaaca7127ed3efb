      "message": "I think that frequency band of amp is required even in the topology, because in the case of multiband amps, the operational values (gain, voa, tilt target mays have defferent values depending on the amplified band). \nBesides, the topo should also let the possibility to input fiber lineic loss as a set of values per frequency, to allow for different slopes in the band.",

However, I\u0027m OK with that because that\u0027s future work anyway, and because we need a sample data format to show to the GUI team now.\n\nWould you be OK with this, or do you prefer to address the multiband use case in the first version of a YANG topology that will be merged?",
