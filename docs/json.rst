JSON Input Files
================

GNPy uses a set of JSON files for modeling the network.
Some data (such as network topology or the service requests) can be also passed via :ref:`XLS files<excel-service-sheet>`.

Equipment Library
-----------------

Design and transmission parameters are defined in a dedicated json file.
By default, this information is read from `gnpy/example-data/eqpt_config.json <https://github.com/Telecominfraproject/oopt-gnpy/blob/master/gnpy/example-data/eqpt_config.json>`_.
This file defines the equipment libraries that can be customized (EDFAs, fibers, and transceivers).

It also defines the simulation parameters (spans, ROADMs, and the spectral information to transmit.)

EDFA
~~~~

The EDFA equipment library is a list of supported amplifiers. New amplifiers
can be added and existing ones removed. Three different noise models are available:

1. ``'type_def': 'variable_gain'`` is a simplified model simulating a 2-coil EDFA with internal, input and output VOAs.
   The NF vs gain response is calculated accordingly based on the input parameters: ``nf_min``, ``nf_max``, and ``gain_flatmax``.
   It is not a simple interpolation but a 2-stage NF calculation.
2. ``'type_def': 'fixed_gain'`` is a fixed gain model.
   `NF == Cte == nf0` if `gain_min < gain < gain_flatmax`
3. ``'type_def': 'openroadm'`` models the incremental OSNR contribution as a function of input power.
   It is suitable for inline amplifiers that conform to the OpenROADM specification.
   The input parameters are coefficients of the :ref:`third-degree polynomial<ext-nf-model-polynomial-OSNR-OpenROADM>`.
4. ``'type_def': 'openroadm_preamp'`` and ``openroadm_booster`` approximate the :ref:`preamp and booster within an OpenROADM network<ext-nf-model-noise-mask-OpenROADM>`.
   No extra parameters specific to the NF model are accepted.
5. ``'type_def': 'advanced_model'`` is an advanced model.
   A detailed JSON configuration file is required (by default `gnpy/example-data/std_medium_gain_advanced_config.json <https://github.com/Telecominfraproject/oopt-gnpy/blob/master/gnpy/example-data/std_medium_gain_advanced_config.json>`_).
   It uses a 3rd order polynomial where NF = f(gain), NF_ripple = f(frequency), gain_ripple = f(frequency), N-array dgt = f(frequency).
   Compared to the previous models, NF ripple and gain ripple are modelled.

For all amplifier models:

|                        |           | amplifier gain to its maximum, within   |
|                        |           | EOL power margins.                      |
+------------------------+-----------+-----------------------------------------+
| ``allowed_for_design`` | (boolean) | If false, the amplifier will not be     |
|                        |           | picked by auto-design but it can still  |
|                        |           | be used as a manual input (from JSON or |
|                        |           | Excel template topology files.)         |

RamanFiber
~~~~~~~~~~

The RamanFiber can be used to simulate Raman amplification through dedicated Raman pumps. The Raman pumps must be listed
in the key ``raman_pumps`` within the RamanFiber ``operational`` dictionary. The description of each Raman pump must
contain the following:

+---------------------------+-----------+------------------------------------------------------------+
| field                     | type      | description                                                |
+===========================+===========+============================================================+
| ``power``                 | (number)  | Total pump power in :math:`W`                              |
|                           |           | considering a depolarized pump                             |
+---------------------------+-----------+------------------------------------------------------------+
| ``frequency``             | (number)  | Pump central frequency in :math:`Hz`                       |
+---------------------------+-----------+------------------------------------------------------------+
| ``propagation_direction`` | (number)  | The pumps can propagate in the same or opposite direction  |
|                           |           | with respect the signal. Valid choices are ``coprop`` and  |
|                           |           | ``counterprop``, respectively                              |
+---------------------------+-----------+------------------------------------------------------------+

Beside the list of Raman pumps, the RamanFiber ``operational`` dictionary must include the ``temperature`` that affects
the amplified spontaneous emission noise generated by the Raman amplification.
As the loss coefficient significantly varies outside the C-band, where the Raman pumps are usually placed,
it is suggested to include an estimation of the loss coefficient for the Raman pump central frequencies within
a dictionary-like definition of the ``RamanFiber.params.loss_coef``
(e.g. ``loss_coef = {"value": [0.18, 0.18, 0.20, 0.20], "frequency": [191e12, 196e12, 200e12, 210e12]}``).

Transceiver
~~~~~~~~~~~

The transceiver equipment library is a list of supported transceivers. New
transceivers can be added and existing ones removed at will by the user. It is
used to determine the service list path feasibility when running the
``gnpy-path-request`` script.

|                      |           | will by the user. The modes are specific|
|                      |           | to each transponder type_variety.       |
|                      |           | Each mode is described as below.        |
+----------------------+-----------+-----------------------------------------+

The modes are defined as follows:

Global parameters
-----------------

The following options are still defined in ``eqpt_config.json`` for legacy reasons, but
they do not correspond to tangible network devices.

Auto-design automatically creates EDFA amplifier network elements when they are missing, after a fiber, or between a ROADM and a fiber.
This auto-design functionality can be manually and locally deactivated by introducing a ``Fused`` network element after a ``Fiber`` or a ``Roadm`` that doesn't need amplification.
The amplifier is chosen in the EDFA list of the equipment library based on gain, power, and NF criteria.
Only the EDFA that are marked ``'allowed_for_design': true`` are considered.

For amplifiers defined in the topology JSON input but whose ``gain = 0`` (placeholder), auto-design will set its gain automatically: see ``power_mode`` in the ``Spans`` library to find out how the gain is calculated.

The file ``sim_params.json`` contains the tuning parameters used within both the ``gnpy.science_utils.RamanSolver`` and
the ``gnpy.science_utils.NliSolver`` for the evaluation of the Raman profile and the NLI generation, respectively.

If amplifiers don't have settings, auto-design also sets amplifiers gain, output VOA and target powers according to [J. -L. Auge, V. Curri and E. Le Rouzic, Open Design for Multi-Vendor Optical Networks, OFC 2019](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/8696699), equation 4.

SpectralInformation
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

GNPy requires a description of all channels that are propagated through the network.
Flexgrid channel partitioning is available since the 2.7 release via the extra ``--spectrum`` option.
In the simplest case, homogeneous channel allocation can be defined via the ``SpectralInformation`` construct which defines a spectrum of N identical carriers:

|                      |           | at :math:`f_{min} + spacing` and the last |
|                      |           | one at :math:`f_{max}`.                   |

|                      |           | gain is set in an amplifier, auto-design  |
|                      |           | sets gain to meet this reference          |
|                      |           | power. If amplifiers gain is set,         |

|                      |           | In power mode, the ``power_dbm``          |
|                      |           | is the reference power for                |
|                      |           | the ``delta_p`` settings in amplifiers.   |
|                      |           | It is also the reference power for        |
|                      |           | auto-design power optimisation range      |
|                      |           | Spans/delta_power_range_db. For example,  |

|                      |           | same power=power_dbm is launched in every |
|                      |           | spans. The network design is performed    |
|                      |           | with the power_dbm value: even if a       |
|                      |           | power sweep is defined (see after) the    |

|                      |           | power_range_db + power_dbm.               |
|                      |           | Power sweep uses the ``delta_p`` targets  |
|                      |           | or, if they have not been set, the ones   |

Arbitrary channel definition
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Non-uniform channels are defined via a list of spectrum "partitions" which are defined in an extra JSON file via the ``--spectrum`` option.
In this approach, each partition is internally homogeneous, but different partitions might use different channel widths, power targets, modulation rates, etc.

For example this example:

.. code-block:: json

 {
   "SI":[
     {
       "f_min": 191.4e12,
       "f_max":193.1e12,
       "baud_rate": 32e9,
       "slot_width": 50e9,
       "roll_off": 0.15,
       "tx_osnr": 40
     },
     {
       "f_min": 193.1625e12,
       "f_max":195e12,
       "baud_rate": 64e9,
       "delta_pdb": 3,
       "slot_width": 75e9,
       "roll_off": 0.15,
       "tx_osnr": 40
     }
   ]
 }

...defines a spectrum split into two parts.
Carriers with central frequencies ranging from 191.4 THz to 193.1 THz will have 32 GBaud rate and will be spaced by 50 Ghz.
Carriers with central frequencies ranging from 193.1625 THz to 195 THz will have 64 GBaud rate and will be spaced by 75 GHz with 3 dB power offset.

If the SI reference carrier is set to ``power_dbm`` = 0dBm, and the ROADM has ``target_pch_out_db`` set to -20 dBm, then all channels ranging from 191.4 THz to 193.1 THz will have their power equalized to -20 + 0 dBm (due to the 0 dB power offset).
All channels ranging from 193.1625 THz to 195 THz will have their power equalized to -20 + 3 = -17 dBm (total power signal + noise).

Note that first carrier of the second partition has center frequency 193.1625 THz (its spectrum occupation ranges from 193.125 THz to 193.2 THz).
The last carrier of the second partition has center frequency 193.1 THz and spectrum occupation ranges from 193.075 THz to 193.125 THz.
There is no overlap of the occupation and both share the same boundary.

.. _equalization:

Equalization choices
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

ROADMs typically equalize the optical power across multiple channels using one of the available equalization strategies — either targeting a specific output power, or a specific power spectral density (PSD), or a spectfic power spectral density using slot_width as spectrum width reference (PSW).
All of these strategies can be adjusted by a per-channel power offset.
The equalization strategy can be defined globally per a ROADM model, or per each ROADM instance in the topology, and within a ROADM also on a per-degree basis.

Let's consider some example for the equalization. Suppose that the types of signal to be propagated are the following:

.. code-block:: json

   {
        "baud_rate": 32e9,
        "f_min":191.3e12,
        "f_max":192.3e12,
        "spacing": 50e9,
        "label": 1
    },
    {
        "baud_rate": 64e9,
        "f_min":193.3e12,
        "f_max":194.3e12,
        "spacing": 75e9,
        "label": 2
    }


with the PSD equalization in a ROADM:

.. code-block:: json

    {
      "uid": "roadm A",
      "type": "Roadm",
      "params": {
        "target_psd_out_mWperGHz": 3.125e-4,
      }
    },


This means that power out of the ROADM will be computed as 3.125e-4 * 32 = 0.01 mW ie -20 dBm for label 1 types of carriers
and 3.125e4 * 64 = 0.02 mW ie -16.99 dBm for label2 channels. So a ratio of ~ 3 dB between target powers for these carriers.

With the PSW equalization:

.. code-block:: json

    {
      "uid": "roadm A",
      "type": "Roadm",
      "params": {
        "target_out_mWperSlotWidth": 2.0e-4,
      }
    },

the power out of the ROADM will be computed as 2.0e-4 * 50 = 0.01 mW ie -20 dBm for label 1 types of carriers
and 2.0e4 * 75 = 0.015 mW ie -18.24 dBm for label2 channels. So a ratio of ~ 1.76 dB between target powers for these carriers.
