      "message": "Can we make it optional? The roll-off is often not specified in datasheets.\n\nAnother thing is that the roll-off is sometimes configurable by the DSP at provisioning. So maybe it should be a range in the equipment library and the desired roll-off within that range could be specified in the service request.",

      "message": "As I understand it, the roll-off is required for ggn simulation. But why can\u0027t we have a default value in the YANG model?\n\nThe range proposal was not meant to solve the case of unknown roll-off. It was meant to model the separate case when the transceiver supports setting the roll-off dynamically within a defined range, i.e. a single value is not sufficient to describe the transceiver. In this case, the chosen roll-off for a specific lightpath value would have to be defined somewhere else, probably in the service request.",

      "message": "I agree with Jonas, in the Yang, when describing the transceiver, a range is useful but should be optional. About the default, my new code set the roll off to zero if it is not provided, but I think we can find a more realistic value for this quantity. For example, in the eqpt_config.json, the basic SI has roll off 0.15.",
