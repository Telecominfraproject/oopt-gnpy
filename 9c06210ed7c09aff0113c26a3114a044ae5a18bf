      "message": "This patch speeds up fiber propagation for \"gn_model_analytic\" quite a lot, which is nice. But it doesn\u0027t seem to do much for \"ggn_spectrally_separated\", which makes the speed difference between the methods even larger than before. Is there any way to take advantage of the new spectral info structure to speed up also \"ggn_spectrally_separated\" or is it already optimized? (I don\u0027t want to hold up this patch, just curious about potential further development.) ",
