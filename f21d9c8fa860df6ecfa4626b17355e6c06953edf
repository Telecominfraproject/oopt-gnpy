      "message": "It\u0027s possible to run a simulation without involving auto-design (not with the current transmission_main_example, I know, but in general). In this case, the SI in eqpt config is just a reference for the propagated spectrum, defined in a separate file, which can cause confusion. I\u0027m ok with keeping it like this for now but I think we should think more carefully about how to structure this in the new yang definitions.",
