      "message": "In general, the fused element after a Raman amplified fiber is needed to take into account the loss after the Raman pumps, in this way the Fiber.con_out loss takes include only the loss before the Raman pumps and it can be applied to them separately.\nIn this specific case, I added the fused even if the introduced loss is zero in order to have a complete Raman pump template. I did set zero loss for the fused because it would have changed all the results of the tests.",
