      "message": "I catched the error, in order to add the information on node uid in the error message, to ease debug. I thought that having wrong parameters in ROADMs was more a configuration error of the ROADM in this case, and was consistant with the catching in cli as well. I have no strong opinion, though, I can raise again ParametersError here, if you believe this is more meaningful.",

In any case I don\u0027t think this is the correct place to change the type of exception. If you really want to change it, I think it should be done in parameters.py where the exception is raised in the first place.\n\nAlso, did you try if adding info on node uid like this really works? It seems to me that if calling RoadmParams results in an exception, super().__init__() will never complete and self.uid will not be set.",
