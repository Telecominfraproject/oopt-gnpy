      "message": "This is very similar to a check that\u0027s already in gnpy/topology/spectrum_assignment.py. The code is not easy for me to follow though, so I cannot offer a direct suggestion, but is it possible to make a helper function for this check? I.e., pass it the requested N and M along with a reference to the transponder from the equipment library, and raise the error from there?",
