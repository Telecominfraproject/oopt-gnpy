      "message": "\u003e With this change, we enable 3 equalizations (taht can be mixed)\n\u003e - power\n\u003e - power spectral density (psd)\n\u003e - user defined power delta\n\nI think this description is potentially misleading. The way I currently understand it is there are 2 equalization options (not 3): power and psd. In addition to that, a user can define a delta per channel which is applied for both power and psd options.",
