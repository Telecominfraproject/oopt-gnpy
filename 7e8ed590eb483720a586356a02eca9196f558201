      "message": "I like the description of the problem, and it seems to me that this is a good fix. On the other hand, I think that the simulation will produce an incorrect result because propagate() will still add the full add_drop_osnr which comprises both ADD\u0027s and DROP\u0027s impairments, not just the DROP contribution. \n\nThat might not be a big problem, the code currently does not check that there\u0027s a ROADM at the destination TRX (I haven\u0027t checked, but I think it does not). Perhaps we can ignore that?\n\nEither way, I\u0027ll be interested in Esther\u0027s opinion.",
