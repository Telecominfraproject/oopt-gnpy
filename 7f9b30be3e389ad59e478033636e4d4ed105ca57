      "message": "This is something that should be true in real implementations. We had a discussion on this during the coders call and I think the only alternative is to set 6.25 GHz instead of 12.5 GHz. In any real implementation, the spacing between two adjacent channels is a multiple of this base sloth width. In order to avoid any restriction in the input central frequencies this condition is not forced, instead, some checks are present in the SpectralInformation constructor to avoid any overlapping.",

I\u0027m not sure if I understand you correctly, but perhaps you need this outside of gnpy-the-public-project? In that case I would prefer to only merge what is absolutely neccessary for gnpy\u0027s own use at this stage, and leave out the convenience functions for later. If that means that we won\u0027t need this function at all, that\u0027s fine with me.\n\nWhat is the use case for creating an arbitrary spectrum with, say, no power defined? Does the convenience of not having to write:\n\n power\u003d0\n\noutweigh the cost of having a rather messy function such as the `dimension_rehsape` above that does not just reshape an array, but also happens to substitute None with some other value? I\u0027m afraid I just don\u0027t find that intuitive and readable :(. If there were documentation, that would have helped, but if it is not needed by this patch series, my (strong) suggestion is to just remove that.",
