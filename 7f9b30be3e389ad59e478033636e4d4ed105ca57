      "message": "This is something that should be true in real implementations. We had a discussion on this during the coders call and I think the only alternative is to set 6.25 GHz instead of 12.5 GHz. In any real implementation, the spacing between two adjacent channels is a multiple of this base sloth width. In order to avoid any restriction in the input central frequencies this condition is not forced, instead, some checks are present in the SpectralInformation constructor to avoid any overlapping.",
