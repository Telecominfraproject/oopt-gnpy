      "message": "When I look at this commit in isolation, I do not fully understand why it is a correct change. So far in today\u0027s master, there\u0027s \"some\" overlap between the SpectralInformation and Pref, and I think that this change blurs the distinction between these a little more, and I\u0027m not happy about that. *Some* of my concerns look like they are partially addressed by the subsequent commits in the series, but I feel like I am missing the big picture here.\n\nEsther, would it be possible to write down a few paragraphs of text (or slides) explaining how you think the end result should look like? How is the spectrum *defined* by the code at the beginning of the propagation, and what data structures are used? What is the reference power, how is it determined, and in what ways is that changed compared to v2.4?",
