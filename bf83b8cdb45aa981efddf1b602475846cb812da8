I\u0027ve refactored this to use a more pytest-common way of doing this via `conftest.py`. While changing that, I found out that the MockSimParams class does not perform anything on top of what SimParams is already capable of, so I simply removed that one. The behavior that you test for stays the same.\n\nCan you please take a look and check that I have not missed anything that you care about, Andrea?",
