      "message": "I agree that it is important for feature parity, but it was not really needed in the first phase as a \"technology demonstrator\". If I recall correctly, the first versions of the draft also insisted on specifying a lat/lon coordinate pair, which makes \"toy topologies\" with X/Y cartesian coordinates harder to implement -- but when I review the draft history today, these are already present in the very first version. So I think the only reason for removal was to implement the bare minimum to let GNPy run.\n\nTL;DR: I\u0027ll bring it back in, it is important for any UI.",
